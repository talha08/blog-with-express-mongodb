## Requirements

* [NodeJs](http://nodejs.org) >= 6.x 
* [mongodb](http://mongodb.org)


## Install

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/talha08/blog-with-express-mongodb.git
$ npm install
```

**NOTE:** Do not forget to set the facebook, twitter, google, linkedin and github `CLIENT_ID`s and `SECRET`s. In `development` env, you can set the env variables by doing

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

and replace the values there. In `production` env, it is not safe to keep the ids and secrets in a file, so you need to set it up via commandline. If you are using heroku checkout how environment variables are set 

If you want to use image uploads, don't forget to set these env variables for
imager config.

```sh
IMAGER_S3_KEY=AWS_S3_KEY
IMAGER_S3_SECRET=AWS_S3_SECRET
IMAGER_S3_BUCKET=AWS_S3_BUCKET
```

then

```sh
$ node server.js
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Tests

```sh
$ npm test

```
